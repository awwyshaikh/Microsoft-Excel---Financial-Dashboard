It gets very overwhelming when you are trying to understand financial data.

Trafflux was suffering with a similar problem, they wanted to visualize their financial KPIs in a single excel window so they do not have to scroll through vast amounts of data to generate insights.

I was provided with the color preference of the organization and bulks of unorganized data. I used simple steps to generate meaningful visualizations.

1. I spent time understanding and organizing the data.
2. I identified potential KPIs that will allow the Trafflux team to have an idea of their overall financial performance. These included:
a. Scorecards of Total revenue, total expenses, and total profit.
b. Bar graphs of revenue and commission by client.
c. Expenses by month.
d. Revenue by month per client.

3. I used the colors of the organization and their preferred designing style to create a dynamic dashboards that updates automatically when new data is entered into it. less
